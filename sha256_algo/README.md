# About

This package consists in a from scratch implementation of SHA-256 algorithm, using go.
That's also a rewriting of another one of my side [project](https://github.com/danieldidiobalsamo/sha256sum_from_scratch), which is a rust from scratch implementation of SHA-256.

As an example of how to use this package, a basic version of sha256sum can be run.

# How to launch
