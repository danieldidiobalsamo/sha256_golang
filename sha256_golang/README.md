# About

This package consists in a from scratch implementation of SHA-256 algorithm, using go.
That's also a rewriting of another one of my side [project](https://github.com/danieldidiobalsamo/sha256sum_from_scratch), which is a rust from scratch implementation of SHA-256.

# How to use

The following [package](../sha256sum_golang) which implements a basic version of sha256sum, can be used as an example of how to use this package.
