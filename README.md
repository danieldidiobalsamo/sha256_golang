# About

This project consists in a from scratch implementation of SHA-256 algorithm, using go.
That's also a rewriting of another one of my side [project](https://github.com/danieldidiobalsamo/sha256sum_from_scratch), which is a Rust from scratch implementation of SHA-256.

There are two packages in this project :
- sha256_golang contains the from scratch SHA-256 implementation
- sha256sum_golang is an example of how to use the previous one, and is a basic version of sha256sum command
